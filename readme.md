# Todos App with MERN

## Background/Purpose
I wanted to learn how to program in REACT so I went to a cool code conference and started to learn the MERN stack. This backend is in Node.js and Express and using that MongoDB baby!

## How to build
Pull down this lovely little codebase, then open a terminal at your workspace location (or easily in VSCode). Use command node ./index.js and she should start running.

## Goals
(*) Extract mongodb connection credentials to an app config
(*) Think of cool things that are relevant here...
